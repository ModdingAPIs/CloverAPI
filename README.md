# CloverPit API

API for CloverPit

## For Mod Users

You can find the Clover API on Thunderstore:
- [CloverAPI on Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/clover-pit/p/ModdingAPIs/CloverAPI/)

### Automatic Installation

Just search for "CloverAPI" in one of these mod managers and install it like any other mod:
- [r2modman](https://ingoh.net/r2modman.zip) (Unofficial build until the next release is out)
- [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/thunderstore-thunderstore_mod_manager)

### Manual Installation

Download the latest release from Thunderstore or GitHub and place the DLL in your `BepInEx/plugins` folder like any other mod.

The API doesn't do anything on its own, so you'll need to install mods that use it to see any effect.

## For Mod Developers

If you're a mod developer looking to use CloverAPI, here are some resources to help you get started:

- See the [BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/api/index.html)
  and [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/intro.html) docs for the basics of modding.
- See the [CloverAPI documentation](https://ingoh.net/cloverapi/) for more information on how to use the API.
- Ask around in the [Panik Games Discord](https://discord.gg/ytgv)'s modding channel if you need help.
- Check out the [Example Mod](https://github.com/IngoHHacks/CloverPitExampleMod) for a basic mod structure and some
  example usages of the API.

The API is currently in beta. Breaking changes may happen, but we'll try to keep them to a minimum.  
Game updates may also break the API. We'll fix it as soon as we can, but please be patient.

It's recommended to add the API as a dependency for all mods, even if you don't use it directly. The API includes various
features that are important for modding, like the save file compatibility layer and showing that mods are installed
on the screen. The developers requested to show whether mods are installed to prevent cheating and confusion.
Please respect this request.

The APIs distribution contains Newtonsoft JSON. Please do not include it in your mod as well, as it may cause conflicts.
Of course, you can still use it in your mod, just don't include it in the distribution.

### Contributing
Just fork the repository, make your changes, and open a pull request. No special process is needed. Although no strict
code style is enforced, please try to keep your code clean and readable. Comments are appreciated.

## License
MIT License.  
See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.  
You may freely distribute CloverAPI to on other platforms. In fact, you're encouraged to do so because I sure won't be uploading it to Nexus Mods or any other platform. Nexus Mods is too much of a hassle and other platforms aren't popular enough to be worth the effort. Maybe once Nexus Mods stops requiring a 5-page survey to upload a mod, I'll consider it.  
Although the MIT license allows you to do pretty much anything with the code, please don't claim it as your own or rebrand it unless you have made significant changes. Just fork the repository and make your changes there. Thanks!  

### TL;DR of the License
You can do whatever you want with the code, as long as you include the original license.
The only thing you can't do is sue me for anything related to the code.
If something breaks, it's your problem, not mine.
But hey, it's open source, so you can always fix it yourself or ask for help.

### License for Builds
You don't need to include the license file when distributing official builds (e.g. releases on GitHub or Thunderstore). They are free from any restrictions.
However, if you build the code yourself, you need to include the license file when distributing it.
Please also include the license file for modified builds.

## Fun Fact
The name "CloverAPI" is a portmanteau of "CloverPit" and "API".  
Really creative, I know. Sometimes I amaze even myself.
