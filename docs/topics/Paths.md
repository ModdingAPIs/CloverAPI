## Root Path
The root path (referred to by `.` in the documentation) depends on the context.
When installing content manually, the path is:  
`[CloverPit]\BepInEx\plugins`.  
When uploading content to Thunderstore, the path is:  
`[Mod Root]\plugins`.  

`[CloverPit]` is the folder where Clover Pit is installed, found by right-clicking the game in Steam and selecting "Manage" -> "Browse local files".  
`[Mod Root]` is the folder where the mod is packaged to. It is the folder where the `manifest.json` file is located.
